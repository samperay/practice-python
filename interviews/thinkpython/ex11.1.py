"""
Exercise 11.1. Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a
dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to
check whether a string is in the dictionary.

If you did Exercise 10.11, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the list in operator
and the bisection search.
