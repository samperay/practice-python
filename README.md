# My Python Learning

Here are some of the detailed information about the programs I have written. I don't consider myself a programmer, But I have started using these little programs as a experiment in using/learning or solving problem myself using Python. I would be glad to accept pointers from others to improve code and make it more efficient. If you would like to suggest me please feel fre to email me at sunlnx@gmail.com

In each program at the beginning, comments are marked to know what this code would be used for.

These examples are being written/tested in python3.5
