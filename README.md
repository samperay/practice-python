# My Python Learning

Here are some of the detailed information about the programs I have written. I don't consider myself a programmer, But I have started using these little programs as a experiment in using/learning or solving problem myself using Python. I would be glad to accept pointers from others to improve code and make it more efficient. If you would like to suggest me please feel free to email me at **sunlnx@gmail.com**

In each program at the beginning, comments are marked to know what this code would be used for.

These examples are being written/tested in python3.5 in Fedora core 25. All programs related to Linux system administration would be kept in sysadmin folder
Few other programs are just for practice on using python code.

sysadmin:

**getsysinfo.py** Provides the basic information on the system

**search_replace.py** Search for a particular pattern in a file, on success take a backup and append in same file

**find_duplicates.py** lists duplicate files from folder specified

**filechecksum.py** compare files using checksum

**list_files_dirs.py** choice to provide either listing of files and directories

**backup_compress.py** make backup copy of folder and compress .gzip format

**deletefilesNdays.py** remove files older than X days

**remotessh.py** execute command in remote through SSH 

**rsync.py** sync two directories and email when synced

**searchlogs.py** search for a pattern in log folders

**yumlocalrepo.py** create local repository on Redhat/Centos Linux
