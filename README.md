# My Python Learning

Here are some of the detailed information about the programs I have written. I don't consider myself a programmer, But I have started using these little programs as a experiment in using/learning or solving problem myself using Python. I would be glad to accept pointers from others to improve code and make it more efficient. If you would like to suggest me please feel fre to email me at sunlnx@gmail.com

In each program, comments are marked to know exactly what's it being used for. I shall write one-liner below for each file being used for. 
I am using python3.5 for these examples.
